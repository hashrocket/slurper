# Slurps stories from the given file (stories.slurper by default) and creates
# Pivotal Tracker stories from them. Useful during story carding sessions
# when you want to capture a number of stories quickly without clicking
# your way through the Tracker UI.

# Default story values and API token information should be provided in a
# ~/.slurper.yml file.

# Note that if you include labels in stories.slurper, they don't appear
# immediately in Tracker. You'll have to refresh Tracker after a few seconds
# to see them.
